# Project Synopsis

## Intelligent Book Recommendation System with Voice Assistant

### Project Overview

This project develops an intelligent book recommendation system with voice assistant designed to assist library visitors in selecting books that align with their interests and preferences. By analyzing user input such as areas of interest, keywords, or past reading behavior, the system generates personalized book suggestions from the library's collection.

### Problem Statement

Readers visiting libraries often possess a general understanding of the concepts or topics they wish to explore but encounter difficulty in selecting an appropriate book. The absence of an intelligent recommendation system that categorizes and suggests books based on individual reader interests leads to confusion and inefficiency in the book selection process.

### Objectives

1. Design an intelligent book recommendation system that suggests books based on individual reader interests
2. Simplify the book selection process, reducing confusion and time spent searching
3. Categorize and organize library books effectively for accurate recommendations
4. Integrate technology with traditional library systems
5. Provide voice assistant system for hands-free book discovery

### Methodology

#### 1. Requirement Analysis
- Identified library user needs and book selection challenges
- Determined required features and functionalities

#### 2. Data Collection & Preparation
- Gathered book collection data (titles, authors, genres, keywords, summaries)
- Preprocessed data for accurate recommendations

#### 3. User Input Analysis
- Designed interface for user interests and keyword input
- Structured data for recommendation engine processing

#### 4. Recommendation Algorithm Implementation
- Applied content-based filtering using TF-IDF vectorization
- Implemented cosine similarity for matching preferences
- Ranked and generated personalized book suggestions

#### 5. System Interface Design
- Developed user-friendly interface with Tailwind CSS
- Added search, filtering, and recommendation features
- Integrated voice assistant capabilities

#### 6. Testing & Evaluation
- Tested with various user queries and scenarios
- Validated recommendation accuracy and relevance
